## Introduction
The **Book Recommendation System** provides personalized book suggestions based on user preferences. Using both collaborative filtering and content-based algorithms, the system recommends books based on similar user ratings and book content.

## Features
- Collaborative filtering to recommend books based on user-item interaction.
- Content-based recommendation using book metadata such as title, author, genre, and tags.
- Scalable to handle a large number of users and books.
- User-friendly interface for entering book preferences and viewing recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and machine learning.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface (optional, if web-based).
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading machine learning models.
- **Cosine Similarity**: For calculating similarities between users/books.
  
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd book-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset by loading the book and user ratings files.
2. Run the recommendation system:
   ```bash
   python recommendation_system.py
   ```
3. If using a web interface, launch the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
